Power analysis for estimating mosquito control efficacy R scripts

Scripts created by Helen Sofaer

	
1) PowerAnalysis01_AbundLogistic_SimulateDataFitModels.R – Simulates mosquito count data assuming a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution. Incorporates realistic abundance-occurrence relationship based on field mosquito data. Plots simulated and observed occurrence vs. abundance relationships. Runs models of abundance and logistic regression to analyze occurrence. Extracts key estimates from models.

2) PowerAnalysis02_AbundLogistic_SummarizePlot.R – Summarizes model outputs. Calculates power from model outputs. Plots: 1) power across parameter sets, 2) distribution of power for the proportion of simulations with significant treatment effects from models of abundance and logistic regression, and 3) power in abundance vs. logistic regression models.
