1) PowerAnalysis_AbundOccur_RunSimulations. This code simulates low density populations of mosquitoes before and after control, tests
	for a significant treatment effect, extracts model estimates, conducts convergence checks, and saves associated model outcome data

	
2) PowerAnalysis_AbundOccu_PlotSimulations. This code creates all main text and supplemental figures associated with this analysis
